# Huffman-Coding-Trees
📘 Project Overview

This project implements Huffman Coding in C++ — a classic lossless data-compression algorithm. The code builds a Huffman tree using a min-heap, assigns optimal prefix-free binary codes to each character based on frequency, and provides functions for encoding and decoding data. The repository demonstrates key algorithmic concepts including tree construction, priority-queue operations, and recursive traversal for generating bit patterns.
